# Stack Overflow Leaderboard

Simple little HTML/JavaScript page which allows you to make a leaderboard for Stack Overflow.

You will need to know the numeric user ids of some of your friends.  I'll use Spolsky (uid:4), Jeff Atwood (uid:1) and Jon Skeet (uid:22656).  Then we can create a URL like:

    [http://neilprosser.github.com/so-leaderboard/index.html?ids=1,4,22656] (http://neilprosser.github.com/so-leaderboard/index.html?ids=1,4,22656)
